# CALM
http://2018.igem.org/Team:Lambert_GA/Software?
\nWe have been able to construct CALM, the Cholera Artificial Learning Model, a system comprised of four extreme-gradient-boosting (XGBoost) machine learning models that, working together, forecast the exact number of cholera cases any given Yemeni governorate will experience for multiple time intervals ranging from 2 weeks to 2 months.

\n The necessary data input files were unfortunately too large to be uploaded (exceeded GitHub's allowed limit). Please email rohilbadkundri@gmail.com for access

\n The files included parse and process the relevant data files, extract features, select features, tune hyperparameters, and deploy the model
